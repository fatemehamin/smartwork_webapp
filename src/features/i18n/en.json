Throughout this process, we make every effort to protect your personal information. Moreover, to provide optimal services, we may utilize data such as location information stored by business owners. \n \n We periodically evaluate and update these policies. Changes to these policies will be implemented when we release a new version and you can review the latest privacy policy changes on the Smart Work website.
